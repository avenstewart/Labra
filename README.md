# Labra — Lightweight Automation & Baseline Reporting Architecture

Labra is a flexible, pluggable, and scalable test automation framework designed to support teams at various stages of testing maturity. Built for heterogeneous environments (C++, Python, SQL), it provides a unified platform for test execution, reporting, and quality observability using modern DevOps tooling.

---

## Overview

Labra provides:

- A Python-based, plugin-style test runner
- Support for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Dockerized infrastructure for easy setup
- CI/CD integration with GitLab pipelines
- Conceptual support for AI-driven test insight using local LLMs (Ollama)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/labra.git
cd labra
```

### 2. Run Tests Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_runner.py --config config/config.yaml
```

### 3. Start Infrastructure

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Configuration

Modify `config/config.yaml` to:

- Select environments
- Enable/disable test types
- Customize output formats
